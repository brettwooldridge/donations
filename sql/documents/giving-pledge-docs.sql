There’s little evidence so far it’s doing that.','2019-06-04',NULL,'Marc Gunther','Chronicle of Philanthropy','Warren Buffett|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation|Bloomberg Philanthropies|Chan Zuckerberg Initiative|Dalio Philanthropies|George Lucas and Mellody Hobson|Good Ventures|Open Philanthropy Project|Simons Foundation',NULL,'Miscellaneous commentary',NULL,'In a long-form article for the Chronicle of Philanthropy, Marc Gunther describes the history of the Giving Pledge, created ten years ago at a meeting including Bill and Melinda Gates, Warren Buffett, Ted Turner, Michael Bloomberg, Charles Feeney, George Soros, Eli Broad, and Oprah Winfrey. Gunther writes that the Giving Pledge has failed to increase the overall level of charitable giving in general, and has not inspired much more charitable giving even among the superrich, to whom it was targeted. The article says that fewer than one in six billionaires in the United States have taken the pledge, and moreover, many of those who took the pledge had either already given or already been planning to give large amounts to charity, so the counterfactual impact of the pledge was low. The article includes a table of the current net worth and total donations so far by the wealthiest signatories of the Giving Pledge, as well as profiles of several Giving Pledge signatories.');
