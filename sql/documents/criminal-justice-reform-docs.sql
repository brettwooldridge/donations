By providing them these funds, they have to spend less time in local jails, and are also in a better position to get legal representation and turn down unfavorable plea deals'),
  # -- Chloe Cockburn's advice (not representing Open Phil)
  ('http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1sj/open_thread_41/fg8','RandomEA comments on Open Thread #41 - Effective Altruism Forum','2018-09-07',NULL,'Chloe Cockburn','Effective Altruism Forum',NULL,'Real Justice PAC|Color of Change|Texas Organizing Project|New Virginia Majority|Faith in Action|People''s Action','Evaluator consolidated recommendation list','Criminal justice reform','In an email exchange with an interested donor, Chloe Cockburn suggests Real Justice PAC as the top choice. Since this is a PAC, the donor asks for other options, and the pros and cons of 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) taking tax advantages of the former into account. Cockburn says that 501(c)(4)s have a significant enough fundraising disadvantage that she would recommend donations only to them at the margin. She identifies Color of Change, Texas Organizing Project, New Virginia Majority, Faith in Action, and People''s Action as potential recipients.
