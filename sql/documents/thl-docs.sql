Archived Version: May, 2014','2014-05-01',NULL,NULL,'Animal Charity Evaluators',NULL,'The Humane League','Evaluator review of donee','Animal welfare','Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) publishes its first detailed review of THL. It identifies the biggest strength of THL as its overall outlook and approach to advocacy, including their strong efforts to assess their own programs, as well as publication of their research through Humane League Labs to affect the thinking of other animal welfare organizations. The main weakness identified was the lack of transparency and clear information about the organization itself, but ACE said that the organization was cooperative when asked to share information. At the time of this review, ACE finds the THL approach of using online ads promising'),

Archived Version: December, 2015','2015-12-01',NULL,NULL,'Animal Charity Evaluators',NULL,'The Humane League','Evaluator review of donee','Animal welfare','Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) publishes an updated review of THL. The review updates on the December 2014 review by noting that the "organizational structure appears to be strong, with a cohesive, positive, and democratic organizational culture promoting positive relationships between THL staff, board members, and volunteers." The weaknesses section is also updated, with notes of concern: "We also have some concerns about their system of considering local offices cost effective as long as they raise as much money as they spend, regardless of their programs’ effectiveness when compared to the national programs’ effectiveness. Finally, we would like to see deeper critical engagement from them with regard to big questions as well as smaller ones like how to interpret particular study findings. One big question that seems especially important for THL is the value of individual dietary change."'),

Archived Version: November, 2017','2017-11-01',NULL,NULL,'Animal Charity Evaluators',NULL,'The Humane League','Evaluator review of donee','Animal welfare','Animal Charity Evalautors (ACE) publishes an updated review of THL. The weaknesses section is updated significantly, noting concern about the sustained high rate of expansion, as well as hoping for deeper critical engagement regarding intervention prioritization and smaller questions such as the implications of specific study findings. To quote: "This is particularly true given that, in the past, a number of studies from HLL have had significant flaws. We hope that HLL’s reorganization under a new director will help in this regard, and there are some positive signs already, including improved analyses of earlier studies."');
