There is a long discussion of how it redefined the way epistemic rationality fit into the curriculum (moving away from a separate low-rating module to something that is incorporated throughout the course through practical application). Comments are supportive, and include the first appearance of Gleb Tsipursky advertising Intentional Insights'),

Consolidated original three goals (Competence, Epistemic Rationality, and Do-Gooding) into single framework of applying epistemic rationality. Emphasis on concept of double crux');
