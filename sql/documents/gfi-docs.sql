Archived Version: November, 2016','2016-11-01',NULL,NULL,'Animal Charity Evaluators',NULL,'The Good Food Institute','Evaluator review of donee','Animal welfare','Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) publishes its first detailed review of The Good Food Institute (GFI). Previously, the then-nascent GFI was mentioned in an ACE review of Mercy For Animals in December 2015 https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/mercy-for-animals/2015-dec/ Given that GFI has been around since only February 2016, both the strengths and weaknesses are speculative. The strengths hinge around the promise of the domain that GFI is working on, as well as its leadership and strategic vision. The weaknesses center around the short track record and the expected long timeframe needed to achieve the ambitious goal of animal-free alternatives');
