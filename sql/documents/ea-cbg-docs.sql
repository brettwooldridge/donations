The post talks about CBG''s commitment to renewing funding for past grantees, and lists some grantees that have received and accepted offers for renewed funding. Changes include: (1) a switch to rolling applications instead of grant rounds, (2) introduction of an "expression of interest" form https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_05IyYJ4fwP1YXytyKrIQMf8mH10Aappq5Dkh5H0Z6a3Ziw/viewform?usp=sf_link for prospective applicants, (3) more tailored process to the needs of different grantees. The blog post also notes that the bar for successful applicants is being raised; reasons include: (1) increasing th focus on the best grantmaking opportunities, based on learnings from the last year of grantmaking, (2) leaving room for future changes to the programme, (3) limited available funding (since funding will rely more on external donors now), (4) prioritising other aspects of the programme, (5) increasing financial reserves, (6) increased quality of granting opportunities.'),

The post expresses concern about centralizing all the decisionmaking power in the hands of one person. Besceli responds in the comments, noting that he does consult others at CEA, and also arguing that at the current scale (disbursement of about $1 million/year, and the equivalent of one full-time worker doing granmaking) it makes sense to have the work primarily handled by one person. His main reason is the value of specialization given the narrow domain of grantmaking.');
