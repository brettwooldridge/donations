The post expresses concern about centralizing all the decisionmaking power in the hands of one person. Besceli responds in the comments, noting that he does consult others at CEA, and also arguing that at the current scale (disbursement of about $1 million/year, and the equivalent of one full-time worker doing granmaking) it makes sense to have the work primarily handled by one person. His main reason is the value of specialization given the narrow domain of grantmaking.');
