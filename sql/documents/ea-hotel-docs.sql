The post introduction says its goal is to make a strong case for the EA Hotel, rather than a balanced one; with the balance being provided by the comments on https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ek299LpWZvWuoNeeg/usd100-prize-to-best-argument-against-donating-to-the-ea The post''s main points: (1) There is a huge chasm in the EA talent pipeline, between talented people who strongly identify as EAs, and projects with strong evidence from such people, due to the missing middle step of lots of people actually trying out their projects. (2) Funding the EA Hotel is a better way to fill this chasm than trying to directly fund individuals. Some of the good things listed about the hotel: no rent, cheap cost of living and low standard of living, propinquity and collaboration, superconnecting and status building. (3) The EA Hotel is an effective incubator. Some of the good things listed: correct acceptance standards (bar not too high), removing trivial inconveniences, a productivity culture, a growth culture, a support culture, and consistent improvement. Goldenberg, who has previously lived in the group houses Event Horizon and Milivia House, and cofounded Gentle Mesa, compares the environment of the EA Hotel favorably to them.

He writes: "I have no idea if this project is a good use of anyone’s time or money, but I find it endearing. Part of this is of course the giant middle finger raised at Henry VIII – undissolution of the English monasteries and all that. But it’s also how I picture a near-term future where everything goes better than expected. A modest basic income could give everyone the opportunity to live a spartan but generally pleasant lifestyle in a friendly and meaningful community of intellectually-aligned people."'),
