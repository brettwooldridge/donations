The comments include a lengthy critique by Matthew Dahlhauser along with a reply from Halstead. The report also discusses why Founders Pledge does not recommend Cool Earth (a charity that Giving What We Can had tentatively recommended in the past for climate change, based on its shallow review), and the comments on the post ask more about the reasoning'),

Cool Earth was tentatively recommended by Giving What We Can (GWWC) as a likely good charity to donate to in the climate change space. The blog post suggests that people interested in donating in the climate change space should read Founders Pledge''s research and recommendations https://founderspledge.com/research/Cause%20Report%20-%20Climate%20Change.pdf In the comments, John Halstead of Founders Pledge writes "I think this may be a cautionary tale of EA hubris, which we should beware of in the future" which sparks a discussion. Also in the comments, Jamie Harris and Brian Tomasik talk of the downside of increasing rainforest cover through the increased amount of wild animal lives and wild animal suffering it causes; Tomasik links to his past calculations for Cool Earth at https://reducing-suffering.org/climate-change-and-wild-animals/#Dont_buy_biomass-based_carbon_offsets'),
