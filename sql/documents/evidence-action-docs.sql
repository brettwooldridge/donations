The diagnosis was that implementation issues led to a slow rate of actual loan disbursement and therefore too small an effect on migration to yield the sought increases in income and consumption. The post mentions how this feedback was used to improve the iteration of the program in 2018, and the results should begin to emerge in early 2019.
