The diagnosis was that implementation issues led to a slow rate of actual loan disbursement and therefore too small an effect on migration to yield the sought increases in income and consumption. The post mentions how this feedback was used to improve the iteration of the program in 2018, and the results should begin to emerge in early 2019.

The main reason cited is allegations of financial irregularities, which led No Lean Season to terminate its relationship with the local implementation partner. The lack of clear positive results is also cited. An accident in Cumilla, Bangladesh, that caused the death of some workers who had received subsidies from No Lean Season, is also mentioned, but not cited as a reason for closing the program');
