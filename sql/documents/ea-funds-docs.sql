Habryka first lists three reasons he is excited about the Hotel: (a) Providing a safety net, (b) Acting on historical interest, (c) Building high-dedication cultures. He articulates three concrete models of concerns: (1) Initial overeagerness to publicize the EA Hotel (a point he now believes is mostly false, based on Greg Colbourn''s response), (2) Significant chance of the EA Hotel culture becoming actively harmful for residents, (3) No good candidate to take charge of long-term logistics of running the hotel. Habryka concludes by saying he thinks all his concerns can be overcome. At the moment, he thinks the hotel should be funded for the next year, but is unsure of whether they should be given money to buy the hotel next door. The comment replies include one by Greg Colbourn, giving his backstory on the media attention (re: (1)) and discussing the situation with (2) and (3). There are also other replies, including one from casebash, who stayed at the hotel for a significant time');

He uses the jargon "counterfactually unique" for grant recommendations that, without the Long-Term Future Fund, individual donors nor larger grantmakers like the Open Philanthropy Project would have identified or funded. Based on that measure, he calculates that 20 of 23, or 87%, grant recommendations, worth $673,150 of $923,150, or ~73% of the money to be disbursed, are counterfactually unique. After excluding the grants that people have expressed serious concerns about in the comments, he says: "16 of 23, or 69.5%, of grants, worth $535,150 of $923,150, or ~58%, of the money to be disbursed, are counterfactually unique and fit into a more conservative, risk-averse approach that would have ruled out more uncertain or controversial successful grant applicants." He calls these numbers "an extremely significant improvement in the quality and quantity of unique opportunities for grantmaking the Long-Term Future Fund has made since a year ago." and considers the grants and the grant report an overall success. In a reply comment, Milan Griffes thanks him for the comment, which he calls an "audit"'),

Of the factors listed, one that generates a lot of discussion is when the fund managers have no way of assessing the applicant without investing significant amounts of time, beyond what they have available. This is considered concerning because it creates a bias toward grantees who are better networked and known to the funders. The need for grant amounts that are big enough to justify the overhead costs leads to further discussion of the overhead costs of the marginal and average grant.
