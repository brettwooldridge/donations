The Open Philanthropy Project spun off from GiveWell, starting as GiveWell Labs in 2011, beginning to make strong progress in 2013, and formally separating from GiveWell in June 2017. It is focused on openness in two ways: open to ideas about cause selection, and open in explaining what they are doing. It has endorsed "hits-based giving" and is working on areas of AI risk, biosecurity and pandemic preparedness, and other global catastrophic risks, criminal justice reform (United States), animal welfare, and some other areas. Grants have three dates associated with them: an internal grant decision date (that is not publicly revealed but is used in some statistics on total grant amounts decided by year), a grant date (which we call donation date; this is the date of the formal grant commitment, which is the published grant date), and a grant announcement date (which we call donation announcement date; the date the grant is announced to the mailing list and the grant page made publicly visible). Lags are a few months between decision and grant, and a few months between grant and announcement, due to time spent with grant writeup approval. Every grant has a grant investigator (called the influencer in our system); grant investigators have been revealed for grants announced starting around July 2017. Grants in focus areas with full-time program officers are generally investigated by the program officer; other grants may be investigated by research analysts. The grant investigator writes a grant writeup for internal use. The public grant writeup is usually not written by the grant investigator, but is approved by the grant investigator and also incorporates feedback from the grantee. Grants listed in the Open Philanthropy Project database that are also separately listed as GiveWell Incubation Grants are not included (these are listed with donor GiveWell Incubation Grants), and grants made by Good Ventures to GiveWell top and standout charities are also not included (these are listed with donor Good Ventures/GiveWell top and standout charities). The investment in Impossible Foods is also not included although it is in the Open Philanthropy Project database. All other publicly announced Open Philanthropy Project grants should be included'),
