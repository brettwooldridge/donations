This is because AMF has the largest remaining Execution Level 1 gap based on the funding gaps identified in November 2016, and reports of funds raised as of February 2017. An additional $0.5 million is being granted to Deworm the World Initiative, and GiveWell recommends that donors giving now should donate all their money to the Against Malaria Foundation',NULL),

The funding to Deworm the World Initiative was decided over other alternatives, including Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, the END Fund, GiveDirectly, Malaria Consortium, and Sightsavers',NULL),
