(The project is currently non-public, so I wonâ€™t give more details here.) I generally think that funding early-stage projects where you have inside information, e.g. by knowing the people involved, is one of the very best ways for small donors to give, so I was excited to come across this project. In this case, I know the founders pretty well and have confidence that they share my values, that they can competently execute the project, and that receiving additional funding quickly was helpful to them, so I saw this as an unusually good opportunity for me as an individual."');
