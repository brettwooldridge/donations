I don’t have the understanding of medicine to know whether what they’re doing is sensible. Donating to the LRI is, fundamentally, a bet on Sarah." Ozy identifies the following characteristics for other people who may be interested in donating to LRI: "(a) Young people who want to selfishly invest in life extension research. (The research is unlikely to bear fruit in enough time to benefit older people.). (b) People who know Sarah Constantin and agree with my assessment of her character. (c) Risk-neutral effective altruists who want to support new projects"',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
  ('Ozy Brennan','Evidence Action',NULL,NULL,'2019-01-03','day','date of donation announcement','Global health and development','https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2019/01/03/donation-post-2018/','Ozy is excited about Evidence Action because of their goal of, and success with, implementing priority programs with rigorous monitoring and evaluation and opennness and transparency about what is and isn''t working. In particular, their openness regarding the underperformance of No Lean Season impressed Ozy. Ozy identifies the following characteristics for others who may be interested in donating to Evidence Action: "(a) People who want to reward Evidence Action for admitting that No Lean Season may not work. (b) People who want to invest in improving charity epistemics. (c) People who want more global poverty charities implementing priority programs to exist."',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
  ('Ozy Brennan','Effective Altruism Funds: Animal Welfare Fund',NULL,NULL,'2019-01-03','day','date of donation announcement','Animal welfare','https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2019/01/03/donation-post-2018/','Donation is to the Animal Welfare Fund (of the four Funds labeled Effective Altruism Funds). The donor, Ozy Brennan, had past experience interacting with Lewis Bollard, chair of the Animal Welfare Fund, at the time they were evaluating Wild-Animal Suffering Research (WASR), when Ozy used to work there. Ozy was impressed by Bollard''s thoughtful approach during the grantmaking process, and continues to be impressed by the grants made by the Animal Welfare Fund, which are innovative, geographically diverse, and hard for small donors to find. Ozy identifies the following characteristics for other people who may be interested in donating to the Animal Welfare Fund: (a) People who prioritize animal welfare and do not think we should concentrate on persuading people to be vegan/vegetarian. (b) People who support "weird EA" animal causes',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
  ('Ozy Brennan','Tostan',100,NULL,'2016-12-22','day','date of donation announcement','Education','https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/12/22/donations-post-2016/','References https://acesounderglass.com/2016/12/01/5167/; says: While I don’t have a firm opinion on the underlying issue, I think that not enough people do independent charity research, and in particular not enough global poverty effective altruists do independent charity research. While GiveWell is an amazing organization, it’s important not to have a single point of failure; a diversity of viewpoints means that we’re more likely to notice their mistakes and things they overlook. And since effective altruism has major talent gaps, it’s good for people to try to fill them. Therefore, I am giving to Tostan to encourage more people to do such research. I will probably give to other charities recommended by particularly impressive blog posts, until it seems like there is enough independent charity research.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
  ('Ozy Brennan','GiveWell',2032,NULL,'2016-12-22','day','date of donation announcement','Charity evaluator','https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/12/22/donations-post-2016/','I do not currently have any particular expertise in charity evaluation. I don’t predict that I will acquire such expertise in the near future, and I am concerned that if I save my money until I have acquired this expertise then all of the tastiest low-hanging fruit will have been plucked by the time I get around to donating. GiveWell seems to me to be highly competent as an organization and to agree with my values; therefore, I think they are a reasonable proxy for what a hypothetical version of me who knew more would donate to.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
