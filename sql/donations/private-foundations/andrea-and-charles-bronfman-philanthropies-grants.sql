At 21/64, they understand the unique skills and perspectives the next generation can bring to the philanthropic community. However, the prospect of engaging the next generation can be daunting. Next-generation family members have grown up with access to broader opportunities fueled by information technology, increased diversity and global connectedness. The questions they ask, language they use, and even their values and priorities change the way the family communicates. The more a family is able to see that “involving the kids” does not only mean adding children to an existing system, but rather shifting the family paradigm to become multigenerational--embracing what each generation brings to the table--the better prepared they will be for the next phase of their foundation’s evolution, and for meeting the needs of the 21st century.')

In that wing the best of Israel’s excavated archeology is presented, and reveals the narrative of the Land of Israel and the people of Israel from earliest times as recorded in archeological materials. When the Museum’s total renewal was planned, the renovation of the archeological wing was undertaken by Charles Bronfman as a most significant contribution to the entire project. The concept was to return to the beautiful design of Alfred Mansfield, the original architect of the Museum and of the wing. James Snyder, director of the Museum today and the guide of the renovation said of Mansfield’s work “With sculptural clarity, his free-floating concrete roof slabs, supported by single central columns in form-cast concrete-clad enclosures, and his clerestory windows emitting translucent light were intended to provide a cool backdrop for the display of the warm stone and clay archeology of the ancient land.” The renovation, completed in 2010, restored Mansfield’s work, reinforced by the most modern and excellent lighting and cases which allow a beautiful and dramatic presentation of thousands of pieces. These relate the narrative in a clear manner, equally accessible to visitors who come with little background and visitors with much background. From pre-historic periods, through the settlement of Canaan, the development of monotheism, the Northern and Southern kingdoms, the history of Jerusalem, Hellenism, the birth of Christianity and the influence of Islam—all appear in the seven galleries of the Wing from a universalistic perspective.')
