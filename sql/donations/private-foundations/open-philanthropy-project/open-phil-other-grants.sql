Based on experience working with Shulman, Open Phil believes that the first $5 million that Shulman could allocate would be better allocated than the last $5 million that Open Phil could allocate. Open Phil is simultaneously experimenting with an “external investigators” program with similar goals but a different setup, namely that grants recommended by external investigators go through our standard process where the reasoning and recommendation is discussed in detail with Open Philanthropy Project decision-makers. Carl is also part of the external investigators program.','Holden Karnofsky','Carl Shulman','2018-05-17','day',NULL,NULL);

It is accompanied by a grant from Luke Ding of $51,250 (so the two grants are in a 3:1 ratio) also influenced by GiveWell. As of the time of entering this, the grant from the Open Philanthropy Project is not listed in the Open Philanthropy Project grants database. Also, the GiveWell page on the grant does not explicitly name either donor. The two grants together are expected to cover two years of costs, including budget for a COO (which they succeeded in doing: Evan McVail joined as COO for a year) and a CEO in 2019','GiveWell');
