<p>This is an online portal with information on donations that were announced publicly (or have been shared with permission) that were of interest to <a href="https://vipulnaik.com">Vipul Naik</a>. The git repository with the code for this portal, as well as all the underlying data, is <a href="https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations">available on GitHub</a>. All payment amounts are in current United States dollars (USD). The repository of donations is being seeded with an initial collation by <a href="https://issarice.com">Issa Rice</a> (see <a href="https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations/commits/master?author=riceissa">his commits</a>) but all responsibility for errors and inaccuracies belongs to Vipul Naik. <strong>Current data is preliminary and has not been completely vetted and normalized; please do not share this data without consulting with Vipul Naik.</strong> We expect to have completed the first round of development by the end of March 2017.</p>
